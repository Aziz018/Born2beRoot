<h1>What is a server?</h1>
A server, in computing, is a computer program or device dedicated to providing services to other computer programs, known as clients, and their users. The physical machine hosting a server program is also commonlyreferred to as a server, which may be a dedicated unit or utilized for various purposes.
In the client/server programming model, a server program awaits and fulfills requests from client programs, <br>either on the same machine or across different computers. The same application on a computer can function as both a client, making requests for services, and a server, fulfilling requests from other programs.
<h1>How Servers Work?</h1>
Physical and Virtual Servers:
A physical server is a computer solely designated for running server software.
A virtual server is a virtualized representation of a physical server, complete with its own operating system and applications, kept separate from other virtual servers on the same physical machine.
Creation of Virtual Machines:
Virtual machines are created by installing a hypervisor on a physical server, allowing it to function as a virtualization host.
The hypervisor manages the physical server's resources, making them available to multiple virtual machines.
Administrators can allocate specific hardware resources to each virtual server, optimizing resource utilization.
Server Software:
A server requires at least two software components: an operating system and an application.
The operating system serves as a platform for running the server application, providing access to hardware resources and dependency services.
Server software enables communication between clients and the server application.
Desktop Computers vs. Servers:
Servers and desktop computers share similarities but differ in several aspects.
Server hardware often includes multiple CPU sockets, error-correcting memory, and redundant components for mission-critical workloads.
Servers are designed for rack mounting, offering a form factor of 1U, 2U, or 4U, unlike desktop towers.
The operating system on servers, such as Windows Server, is distinct from desktop operating systems like Windows 10.
Types of Servers:
Examples include web servers, application servers, proxy servers, mail servers, virtual servers, blade servers, file servers, policy servers, database servers, and print servers.
Each type serves specific purposes, such as hosting websites, managing applications, or facilitating file sharing.
Server Components:
Hardware:
Server hardware comprises components like a rack-mount chassis, power supply, system board, CPUs, memory, storage, and network interface.
Out-of-band management allows remote monitoring and management, independent of the operating system.
Operating Systems:
The server operating system, such as Windows Server or Linux, acts as the platform for applications, providing access to hardware resources and network connectivity.
What is a virtual machine?
A virtual machine (VM) is a simulated representation of a physical computer, functioning as a guest within a host machine. Virtualization allows the creation of multiple VMs on a single physical device, each running its own operating system and applications. To facilitate communication between VMs and the underlying hardware, a hypervisor, a lightweight software layer, is employed. The hypervisor manages the allocation of resources, ensuring isolation between VMs and preventing interference.
The virtualization process involves the separation of the operating system and applications from the hardware on a bare metal server. This allows the server to be partitioned into independent VMs that share the original resources, such as memory and storage, with the hypervisor overseeing resource allocation to maintain isolation.
What is a hypervisors?
A hypervisor, also known as a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM), is a crucial component in virtualization technology. It is a software or firmware layer that enables the creation and management of virtual machines (VMs) on a physical host machine. The primary function of a hypervisor is to abstract and virtualize the underlying hardware, allowing multiple operating systems to run concurrently on the same physical hardware.
There are two main types of hypervisors:
Type 1 Hypervisor (Bare Metal Hypervisor):
This type of hypervisor runs directly on the physical hardware without the need for a host operating system. It takes control of the hardware resources and manages the execution of multiple VMs independently. Examples of Type 1 hypervisors include VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V Server, and Xen.
Type 2 Hypervisor (Hosted Hypervisor):
In contrast, a Type 2 hypervisor runs on top of a host operating system. It acts as an application and relies on the host OS for resource management. This type is often used for development or testing purposes on desktop or laptop systems. Examples include VMware Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox, and Microsoft Hyper-V (when installed on a Windows OS).
What is the basic functioning of their virtual machines?
The basic functioning of virtual machines (VMs) involves creating and managing virtualized instances of computer systems within a host machine.
Benefits of virtual machines?
Cost Efficiency:
Before the adoption of virtualization, organizations spent a considerable portion of their IT budget on acquiring physical servers. With virtualization, robust hardware can accommodate multiple virtual systems, reducing the overall hardware expenditure.
Extending the lifespan of legacy software is more cost-effective with virtual machines (VMs).
Efficient Provisioning:
Recovery from disasters or server failures is expedited in virtualized environments. Virtual machines can be replicated or cloned swiftly, requiring only minutes to bring systems back online, compared to the hours or days needed for physical server replacements.
Enhanced Productivity:
IT teams experience increased productivity as they only need to manage the host machines. Traditional datacenters without virtualization face more cumbersome hardware maintenance tasks.
Streamlined DevOps:
Maintenance operations have minimal impact on production environments, often eliminating the need for downtime during maintenance tasks.
VMs facilitate simplified testing and development processes for applications and websites.
Enhanced Security Through Isolation:
Virtual machines provide full isolation, ensuring greater security as communications between the guest OS and host pass through the hypervisor.
Portability for Legacy Applications:
VMs are standalone and portable, allowing easy copying and cloning between hosts. This feature enables better support for older applications, which may not be compatible with the host OS in containers.
